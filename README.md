## Project Overview
The project dedicates to transform drug discovery from a slow, sequential, and high-failure process into a rapid, integrated, and patient-centric model. We are integrating high performance computing, diverse biological data, and emerging biotechnologies to create a new pre-competitive platform for drug discovery.

## Project Objective
The goal of project is to see the potential possibility of applying models that trained based on small dataset to larger dataset. <br>

## Pipeline & Packages
The ATOM Modeling PipeLine (AMPL) extends the functionality of DeepChem and supports an array of machine learning and molecular featurization tools. AMPL is an end-to-end data-driven modeling pipeline to generate machine learning models that can predict key safety and pharmacokinetic-relevant parameters. <br>

An [article describing the AMPL project](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b01053) was published in JCIM. For those without access to JCIM, a preprint of the article is available on [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05211).
